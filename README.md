# Sorting algorithms

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
